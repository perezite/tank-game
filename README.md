# tank-game

An action game where a tank must fight its way through a 3D city full of hostile enemy tanks.

A fighter tank must stand its ground in a city filled with enemy tanks. The tank can collect two different power-ups during the game: One recreates life energy, the other equips the tank with a grenade launcher.  

## Project Description

This game was created as a final project during the lecture '[Computer Graphics Lab](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/vmml/teaching/lectures/computer-graphics-fs20.html)' at the University of Zurich, in cooperation with two fellow students.

The goal of the project was the implementation of a functioning video game in a group of three during a time period of three weeks.  
Due to the tight time constraint, the game still contains various bugs like a quirky enemy ai, clipping errors and missing textures.

My assignment in the project group was the implementation of the ballistics for grenades and projectiles, the implementation of the particle systems as well as the programming of a fast and precise collision detection.
